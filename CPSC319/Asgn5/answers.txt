1. My hash functions works by starting with a large prime number then XOR ing every character of a string and 
    multiplying it by a very large prime number and summing the entire string
2. My hash functions works good but it could be improved by using a long instead of an int for more encoding
3. It works at the same percentage in my tests
4. My function would work better due to each number creating an individual key and no repeats due to same letters
